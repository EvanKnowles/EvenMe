In a by-election in the Newcastle Local Municipality on Wednesday, the IFP snatched a ward from Team Sugar South Africa (TSSA), where the MK Party performed strongly in the May general elections. The IFP's performance will also come as a blow to the MK Party which received 59% of the vote there during the 29 May general elections. The ward became vacant when TSSA terminated its councillor's membership.

However, the IFP now reigns supreme after its candidate Johan Bhekinkosi Zwane bagged an 852-vote victory in the ward, where 2 175 votes were cast. From this tally, only four voters had chosen the EFF, which announced its support for TSSA just a day before the by-election. The MK Party's Mesuli Mhlengi Mabaso garnered 614 votes, followed by Team Sugar's Shedrack Thwala (361), the ANC's Praismon Maya (283) and Rise Mzansi's Ntokozo Sibisi (27). Explaining why the EFF threw its weight behind TSSA, EFF KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Mongezi Twala said it was a "strategic alliance" aimed at advancing social development in the Newcastle region.
