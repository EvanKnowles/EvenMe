Cogta Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa says the District Development Model must be institutionalised to turn around dysfunctional municipalities. The model was developed during the previous ANC-led administration. While the ANC still supports the model, its fellow GNU partners, the DA, opposes it. The debate on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa's budget vote speech – under the theme "Every Municipality Must Work" – laid bare another difference in policy among government of national unity (GNU) partners. The minister, who leads the IFP, made a commitment to implement the District Development Model (DDM) – the previous ANC-administration's plan to improve flailing local governance. While the ANC re-endorsed the plan, the DA voiced its strong objection to it during Tuesday's debate at a mini-plenary of the National Assembly. "Under the government of national unity, our mission is clear: to improve the basic service delivery, foster inclusive economic growth, urgently address poverty and combat corruption," said Hlabisa. "We intend to eradicate fragmentation in planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring of the government programmes," he said, adding: Without question, our first task is to turn around the dysfunctional municipalities. Accordingly, this budget is delivered under the theme, 'Every Municipality Must Work'. "This is a clarion call to action, to build a functioning community-centred local government, which is responsive to the needs and aspirations of our people," Hlabisa said. He added that the department's State of Local Government report highlighted 66 municipalities in need of urgent attention. "We therefore must institutionalise the District Development Model." Portfolio Committee on Cogta chairperson, ANC MP Zweli Mkhize, agreed on the implementation of the DDM. "The advent of the District Development Model was meant to improve in the alignment and coordination and to improve cooperation and create an ethical and developmental state with a higher performance and accountability. This would then create an impact in joint planning, joint budgeting, and joint implementation," Mkhize said. He said the committee expressed the need for the department to demonstrate more success in implementing the DDM beyond pilot sites and welcomed the minister's statement to this effect.

"While change is needed to improve the state of the local government sector in South Africa, the District Development Model is not the answer," she said. "Adopted by Cabinet on 21 August 2019, the DDM is purportedly aimed at coordinating and implementing an integrated service delivery approach at district and metro levels. Despite these lofty goals, its implementation across three pilot sites, namely, OR Tambo District Municipality in the Eastern Cape, the Waterberg District Municipality in Limpopo and the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality in KZN, has not achieved any tangible change except an accelerated deterioration in service delivery," she added. Van Zyl submitted that the DDM regulations, by attempting to centralise governance and reduce municipalities' autonomy, may be in violation of Section 151(4) of the Constitution, which protects municipalities' rights to exercise their powers and perform their functions. "The Democratic Alliance firmly rejects the DDM's philosophy and implementation as it distances governance and decision-making from the people." In a move typical of pre-GNU debates of this nature, she contrasted the performance of DA-run municipalities with ANC-run municipalities. ANC MP Sharon Davids said in response: "Compliance is not good governance." Davids also endorsed the DDM. "It is our firm belief that aligning our efforts and resources through the DDM and the results-based management office, we will be able to streamline service delivery and improve the lives of all our people we serve," she said.

"This method refers to all three spheres of government, sector departments and state entities operating like a single unit in relation to achieving developmental objectives and outcomes in these district and metropolitan spaces over a multi-year period and over multi-term electoral cycles," Cogta's website reads. Another GNU partner gave conditional support to the Cogta department. Like virtually all the participants in the debate, Rise Mzansi's Makashule Gana was gravely concerned about the level of mismanagement at municipal level. "When it comes to municipalities, we are dealing with manmade disasters," said Gana. He added: This problem of local government was created by men and women who got greedy and started to steal. And it has to be fixed by good men and women. He pledged his party's support, before adding: "But if you continue to deploy unqualified cadres to our municipalities, we'll not support you."

However, two GNU partners, the DA and FF Plus, expressed their opposition to it.
