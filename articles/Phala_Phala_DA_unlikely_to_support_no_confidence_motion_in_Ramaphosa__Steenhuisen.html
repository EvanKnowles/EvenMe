The DA looks set to support Cyril Ramaphosa in his Phala Phala fight. The party's support, however, will depend on how the issue returns to Parliament, should it occur at all. John Steenhuisen made it clear the DA would not support a no confidence motion in Ramaphosa. Should President Cyril Ramaphosa's Phala Phala saga return to Parliament, the DA will side with Ramaphosa. According to DA leader John Steenhuisen, the Phala Phala matter pales in significance compared to the VBS scandal, involving EFF leaders Floyd Shivambu and Julius Malema. "We will take our chances on the side of the president on this one, rather than take it with those that seek to bring down a government, so that they can then negotiate their way back into government," Steenhuisen said. During a press briefing on Wednesday, he gave a clear indication that the party would support Ramaphosa, should he need it, in defence of Phala Phala. The saga involves the US$580 000 stuffed into a couch at Ramaphosa's private farm, Phala Phala.

"You would have to see what happens in Parliament. As you know, [Parliament] went through a process and in the sixth Parliament, and the matter was discharged... then it would depend what form if it were [to be] brought back, whether it's a motion of no confidence. "[The DA] would be unlikely to support a motion of no confidence because, frankly, Phala Phala pales into insignificance in the light of the Matodzi-affidavit and with the acts of blatant corruption [and] state capture that are evident by the people who would no doubt bring such a motion, to try to bring the government down," he said. Steenhuisen was referring to the explosive affidavit deposed by convicted fraudster Tshifhiwa Matodzi, which confirmed major aspects of advocate Terry Motau's investigation report into the collapse of the VBS Mutual Bank in March 2018.

Matodzi, who is VBS' former chairperson, was convicted and sentenced to an effective 15 years in jail for his crimes that helped collapse the Limpopo-based bank, with more than R2 billion stolen by its executives and shareholders in an elaborate fraud. In his 'The Great Bank Heist' report into the collapse of the bank, Motau found 53 "persons of interest" illegally received about R1.89 billion from the bank between March 2015 and June 2018. Matodzi implicated Dondo Mogajane, the former National Treasury director-general, in the VBS looting. He also, under oath, provided a direct link to Malema and Shivambu in the alleged thieving. Steenhuisen said: So Bill Clinton famously said the biggest question in politics is compared to what, and compare that to what is sitting on the other side in the gruesome benches of the EFF and MK [Party]. "I think that we will take our chances on the side of the president on this one rather than take it with those that seek to bring down a government, so that they can then negotiate their way back into government for no altruistic purpose and no purpose other than to get their hands on state resources. "In this way, they can stop the flow of those resources into the networks that have now been starved by the fact that there's a new government in town." The ATM filed court papers, asking the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to set aside the Public Protector's Phala Phala report. READ MORE | What did Dondo do? The DG, the minister's daughters and the VBS 'bribes' In June 2023, advocate Kholeka Gcaleka cleared Ramaphosa of wrongdoing, but found Major-General Wally Rhoode, the head of the Presidential Protection Service, was not authorised to investigate the burglary on the farm. However, a Section 89 Independent Panel report, which examined whether there was enough evidence to impeach the president, found Ramaphosa had a case to answer to in Parliament. The SA Reserve Bank found the US$580 000, paid as a deposit for buffalo by a Sudanese buyer, which was hidden in a sofa by an employee, and subsequently stolen in a robbery, did not violate any exchange control laws.
