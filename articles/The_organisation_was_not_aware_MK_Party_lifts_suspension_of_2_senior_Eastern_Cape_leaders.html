The MK Party has lifted the suspension of its two senior leaders in the Eastern Cape. They were accused of factionalism by the party's provincial convener. The MK Party's Eastern Cape coordinator has lamented the convener for suspending the leaders. The MK Party's Eastern Cape leadership has lifted the suspension of its two senior leaders and says there will be consequences for provincial convener Pumlani Kubukeli, if he is found to have acted outside the party's guidelines in authorising the suspensions. Last Monday, Kubukeli authorised the suspension of the MK Party's provincial organiser and former Buffalo City metro speaker, Luleka Simon-Ndzele. On the same day, Kubukeli also suspended the party's Buffalo City convener, Nozizwe Otola. In the suspension letters, the two were accused of ill-discipline and factionalism. Kubukeli accused Simon-Ndzele of "parallelism" and the "undermining of upper structures and their authority, thereby causing paralysis to the functioning of the organisation". Otola was accused of "intentionally participating in acts of factionalism and parallelism to legitimate structures of the organisation". Simon-Ndzele is one of the accused in the Nelson Mandela funeral fraud case of R10 million that will be back in the Eastern Cape High Court in Bhisho on 14 October. Contacted for comment last week, Kubukeli did not deny authoring the letters but referred News24 to MK Party spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndhlela who was not available for comment at the time.

In separate letters to the two, Ndakisa said the decision to lift the suspensions was taken at a party provincial meeting on 10 July. "The [interim provincial leadership] meeting that sat [on 10 July] received a preliminary verbal report from the national peace and stability sub-committee on allegations regarding your alleged behaviour and misconduct, carried of course by the high spirit of building a strong and coherent organisation underpinned by the character of our organisation," Ndakisa added in similarly worded letters to the two. He also wrote the MK Party decided to "resolve political issues, politically". Ndakisa said their suspension had been lifted with immediate effect. Speaking to News24, he launched a scathing attack on Kubukeli, saying the decision to suspend the two was procedurally flawed. "The organisation was not aware of the suspension. The [Kubukeli] decision lacked the understanding on how the organisation works. "I suspect that decision had a third force element," claimed Ndakisa. He accused Kubukeli of being surrounded by ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa's sympathisers. Ndakisa said: Kubukeli is surrounded by people who campaigned for Cyril [Ramaphosa]. Those people are anti- [Jacob] Zuma. Their aim is to collapse a Zuma-led party. Some of them were from COPE. He added he was shocked to see the suspension letters. "He [Kubukeli] cannot just wake up and suspend leaders. "He is so impatient with everyone in the MK Party, but we are patient against him. If we found that he is working for the ANC, we are going to take drastic action against him. "We don't believe he committed a genuine mistake when issuing those letters," said Ndakisa. Attempts to get comment from Kubukeli, through messages and phone calls, were unsuccessful. Last week, Simon-Ndzele told News24 allegations against her were scanty and lacked substance. Both Simon-Ndzele and Otola confirmed on Tuesday they had received letters from Ndakisa lifting their suspension.
