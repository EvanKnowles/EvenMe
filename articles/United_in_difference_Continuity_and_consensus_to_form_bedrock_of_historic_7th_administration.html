President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver his Opening of Parliament Address on Thursday. His address marks the first since new rules were adopted in Parliament to draw a distinction between the Opening of Parliament Address and the annual State of the Nation Address. It is expected that the president will not announce major changes to policy. Policy continuity, consensus, reform and unity are set to characterise President Cyril Ramaphosa's ushering in of the historic seventh administration. These are the themes expected to form the basis of Ramaphosa's Opening of Parliament address, which takes place on Thursday at 19:00. The address, while being the first of the 11-party government of national unity (GNU), is not anticipated to announce major changes to policy - and follows the "highly successful" Cabinet lekgotla held over the weekend. Both Ramaphosa and DA leader John Steenhuisen described the meeting as "very constructive" and "optimistic" and as having highlighted overall policy consensus. The programme adopted by the lekgotla was based on a presentation by the Forum of Directors-General, which collated the areas of policy common to all parties in the GNU. It is this commonality and consensus that appears to be the focus of the GNU government and is likely to underpin Ramaphosa's address. At a press briefing on Wednesday, Steenhuisen outlined his party's expectations for Thursday night's speech. He said his party had been pleasantly surprised by the ANC's "collegiality and constructive spirit" in engaging with GNU parties. "I don't think we should take it lightly… we have seen a peaceful transition of power from one government to another, in a democratic manner. This is not a given on our continent and certainly not in other parts of the world, and I don't think we should under-emphasise how significant this is and what a sign of democratic health this is for us as a country," he said on Wednesday.

But, even here, he thought it would be possible for the parties to find one another on aspects of the NHI Act on which they had differed. At his press conference on Wednesday, he said: There is no single party that does not believe we need universal access to healthcare and that something must be done to improve the quality… [We agree that] nobody should be deprived of care on the basis of affordability. Steenhuisen said he believed the NHI Act could be tweaked and there should be discussions to start implementation, which could move toward improving the public healthcare sector and partnering with the private healthcare sector. "It's my view that the NHI in its current form will frustrate universal access to basic healthcare for at least a generation," he said. "I think that there are some areas where the bill can be amended or changed, or the approach and regulations can be changed to reintroduce choice to treat the private sector as a partner in fixing the public healthcare sector." Ramaphosa signed the NHI Act into law ahead of the 29 May general elections, amid criticism and threats of legal action from various parties, healthcare organisations and business groups. Critics argue the act, as it stands, is unconstitutional, unworkable, unaffordable, and would hinder access to quality public healthcare. The national executive consists of 77 members. (GCIS/Supplied) Steenhuisen pledged in May - before the GNU government was formed - to challenge the legislation in the Constitutional Court, but since being in government, he has adopted a pragmatic approach. "I think we can find each other as the parties in the GNU. I think we all want the same thing; we just have slightly different ideas about how we're going to get there. So that will be an ongoing discussion within the GNU as we proceed," Steenhuisen said. How the GNU partners work out policy differences, such as NHI, will determine both its longevity and success.

"The Opening of Parliament Address serves as a pivotal platform for the president to articulate the administration's comprehensive plans and long-term vision for the upcoming five-year term," said National Assembly Speaker Thoko Didiza at a briefing on Wednesday. "This landmark event not only outlines the government's strategic objectives and policy priorities, but also officially inaugurates the new parliamentary term. It symbolises the continuity of democratic governance and sets the stage for legislative and executive collaboration in addressing national challenges and pursuing the country's development goals. "The State of the Nation Address (SONA), delivered annually by the president in February, serves as a platform to review the government's past-year performance and outline its agenda for the coming year." Furthermore, the joint rules also aim to maintain order and decorum in the chamber during joint sittings. Last year's SONA, also a joint sitting, was marred by EFF members storming the podium as Ramaphosa was addressing the Houses. Didiza said: Key provisions of the new rules prohibit members from interrupting the president during the Opening of Parliament Address and further stipulate that this joint sitting must focus solely on the specific business for which it is convened. "These measures are designed to preserve the dignity of Parliament and underscore the importance of these addresses in shaping the nation's legislative and developmental agenda." Thursday's sitting will also see the newly elected third-largest party in Parliament, Jacob Zuma's MK Party, face the former president’s self-proclaimed nemesis, Ramaphosa, for the first time. The MK Party forms part of the Progressive Caucus, along with the EFF and other small parties. It is set to brief the media on its approach to the opening address at midday on Thursday.
