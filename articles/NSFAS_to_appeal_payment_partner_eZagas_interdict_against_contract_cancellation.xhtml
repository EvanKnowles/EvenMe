The troubled National Student Financial Aid Scheme intends to appeal a Western Cape High Court judgment interdicting its attempt to cancel a contract. The scheme wants to do so on the recommendations contained in a report by Werksmans Attorneys and advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, SC. NSFAS says it stands by its position to implement the recommendations in the report. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) intends to appeal a Western Cape High Court ruling on the Department of Higher Education and Training's attempt to get the scheme out of a controversial contract. The company, eZaga, was awarded the contract for the direct payment of allowances to university students and TVET colleges for five years from July 2022, along with three other companies: Coinvest Africa, Tenet Technology and Norraco Corporation. When NSFAS attempted to cancel the contract, eZaga headed to court with an urgent application for an interdict. The court granted the order in eZaga's favour on Monday.

They found that the tender had been awarded irregularly. Mnisi said: The judgment seeks to restore eZaga's contractual position with NSFAS. The order granted was reached without taking into consideration the validity of the tender award on which the contract is premised. The Special Investigating Unit and NSFAS' application to set aside the contract is already pending at the Special Tribunal. "NSFAS stands by its position of implementing the recommendations made in the Werksmans report and will appeal this judgment in addition to the application at the Special Tribunal." Among other things, eZaga sought an order preventing NSFAS from: allowing universities and TVETs to distribute the payments; and implementing a payment mechanism with the help of its banker to make the payments directly into students' accounts. Background One of the alleged irregularities pertaining to the tender was that the NSFAS CEO at the time, Andile Nongogo, had links to Coinvest Africa. Nongogo was fired late last year after the Werksmans and Ngcukaitobi probe. Among other things, they recommended the termination of the four companies' contracts. eZaga asked the court to order NSFAS to implement the service-level agreement, issue payment instructions and make payments to the company so it could continue paying students. The Western Cape High Court has interdicted NSFAS from taking steps to terminate its service-level agreement with a service provider that was awarded a contract to pay allowances into students' bank accounts.

That culminated in the ruling against NSFAS on Monday. On-and-off use One of the disputes was whether then-NSFAS chairperson Ernest Khosa had, in a meeting late last year, advised the four companies that their contracts had been terminated due to non-compliance with the entity's supply chain management policy, shortfalls therein, and changes in tender requirements, among other things. It is disputed whether former NSFAS chair Ernest Khosa advised companies that their contracts had been terminated due to non-compliance with the NSFAS' supply chain management policy. (OJ Koloti/Gallo Images) Gallo Images Despite that meeting, the entity issued a circular earlier this year, informing universities the four companies would continue to be used to dole out cash to students. According to court documents, this infuriated Ngcukaitobi, who probed the contracts. On 24 April, NSFAS decided to stop using the service providers. In late May, the SIU and NSFAS applied before the Special Tribunal to interdict the service-level agreements between the four companies and the scheme. Last April, the SIU revealed to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts that prior to the implementation of the direct payment tender, more than 40 000 undeserving students had accessed NSFAS funds worth R5 billion.
