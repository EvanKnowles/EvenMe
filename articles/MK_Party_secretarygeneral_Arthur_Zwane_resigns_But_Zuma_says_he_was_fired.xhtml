Former president Jacob Zuma's MK Party has appointed its fourth secretary-general. This comes after the party issued letters to four party leaders informing them of the changes. But the party's most recent secretary-general, Arthur Zwane, said that he had resigned with immediate effect. Former president Jacob Zuma's MK Party has appointed its fourth secretary-general in less than six months. This after its most recent secretary-general, Arthur Zwane, said that he resigned with immediate effect in writing on 1 July - months after the party appointed him to replace Sihle Ngubane. Ngubane had replaced Thanduxolo "Gorbachev" Dyodo, who was dismissed after a series of administrative bungles. In Zwane's resignation letter, he wrote: "In the last two weeks, I have realised that the volume of work in my office is huge and beyond my limits, especially because I have other competing business interests that I'm pursuing." Zuma, however, had a different version of events. According to the MKP leader, he had written a letter of his own to Zwane to say that he was "relinquishing" him as the secretary-general.
